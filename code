# Interference Resonance Mass Model (IRMM) â€” Python Implementation

This Python script implements the core logic of the **Interference Resonance Mass Model (IRMM)**, a framework for predicting particle masses using interference vectors formed from the logarithms of universal constants.

---

## ðŸ§ª What It Does

- Transforms particle masses into **logarithmic Planck-normalized space**
- Computes **interference vectors** from:
  - \(\log_{10}(\pi)\)
  - \(\log_{10}(e)\)
  - \(\log_{10}(\hbar)\)
- Trains a linear regression model using known fermion and baryon masses
- Predicts all known masses with near-zero error
- Plots each particle in a **3D interference node space**
