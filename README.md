# IRMM Python Script

This script implements the Interference Resonance Mass Model (IRMM) using a three-constant interference vector to predict the masses of elementary and composite particles.

## Features
- Normalizes masses in log₁₀ space
- Builds 3D interference vectors using (π, e, ħ)
- Performs linear regression to fit μ
- Predicts particle masses
- Visualizes nodes in 3D resonance space

## Usage
```bash
python irmm_model.py
```

Requires:
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
