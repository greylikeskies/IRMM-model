# Interference Resonance Mass Model (IRMM)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Interference Resonance Mass Model (IRMM)** — a novel framework proposing that the masses of elementary and composite particles emerge from standing wave nodes formed by interference in logarithmic space constructed from universal constants.

### 🧠 What Is IRMM?

IRMM is based on a simple but powerful hypothesis:
> Particle mass is not fundamental, but **emerges from harmonic interference patterns** formed in a space defined by universal constants such as \(\pi\), \(e\), and \(\hbar\).

By encoding particle mass logarithmically and comparing it to interference vectors from combinations of constants, IRMM accurately predicts the masses of:
- All known **fermions**
- All measured **mesons** and **baryons**

The model achieves **machine-precision** fit with zero tuning — using only constants.

### 📄 Papers

This repository includes the full theoretical development, divided into three parts:

- 📘 `IRMM_Part1_Fermions.pdf`  
  Predicts all fundamental fermion masses using constant-pair interference vectors.

- 📙 `IRMM_Part2_Particles.pdf`  
  Extends the model to **all known particles** using three-constant vector space.

- 📗 `IRMM_Part3_EmergentSpacetime.pdf`  
  Proposes a mechanism for spacetime and fields to **emerge** from the same resonance geometry, potentially linking GR and QM.

All constants used are in log₁₀ scale. The Planck mass is used for normalization.

### 🔧 Tools (Coming Soon)

We are currently developing:
- A Python/Colab-based mass prediction calculator
- Visualizations of particle positions in interference node space
- Simulation tools for phase coherence and spacetime implications
